Tempus Movies could not have been created without Whufclee, 564_26, Graciesmiles242 and Pyramid. Thank you for your overwhelming support, guidance, and advice. Tempus Movies would not be alive without you. A HUGE shoutout goes to all of Team Looking Glass. You guys have had my back from day 1 and have shown me what a true family is. You all have my deepest respect and I look forward to continuing to evolve and grow as a developer in this community.
